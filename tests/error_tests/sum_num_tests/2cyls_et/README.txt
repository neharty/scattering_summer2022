Runs are organized to show how spacing, object size and wavenumber affect the absolute 
error at a point, and to verify the formula given in Antoine.

The absolute error is 
    |u - u_ref|
where u = Antoine solution (solution with M = N_p) and u_ref has M=2*M_p. Note the 
absolute error plots are the log of the error. The white spots mean there is no error between
u and u_ref, that is a white spot corresponds to log(0).
